-Shows countries that are order by highest revenue alongside with trendlines for each country to see performance over time.


-The key takeaway here is that that UK is our biggest market and has the most revenue with over 1M pounds which trumps all of the other countries extremely.

-From October 2010 to December 2011, it is seen that revenue has been graduately increasing. However, between the months on November 2011 to December 2011, revenue drastically decreases by 82%.


-We want to find the major factor that is causing this. The amount of customers per month lines up almost directly with the revenue trend line. This can conclude that the amount of custimers visited from our UK stores have much more to with the sudden decrease in revenue earnings.


-On the side of each chart, two charts displaying positive regression trends are shown on the right side of each chart. This is the correlation between the amount of customers and revenue, and we want to find out if there is a strong correlation between the two. These dots that correspond between the amount of customers and revenue are almost aligned with our regression line which makes this a strong correlation. Which proves that customer retention heavily affects revenue earnings.

-This depicts monthly reveue trend that has aquired the most revenue for the business other than the UK. These countries include France, Germany, Singapore, Portugal, and Spain.


-Most of the countries cap out with a decreasing trend from the months of Nov 2011 to Dec 2011.


-The only countries that have an upward trend are Singapore and Portugal. What I notice was that Singapore only had records up until October and no information after that. And Portugal has the largest percent increase in this group.


-As we see there are more markets plumiting in revenue which raises concern and it should help as put more focus on the ones that are suffering the most. We should also place more concern on Singapore since we don't have have much data from Nov-Dec, and look into Portugal to help retain this status.

-Depicts countries that are generating not the biggest and also not the least amount of money, but they are somewhere in the middle in comparison to the smaller and bigger markets when generating revenue.


-There are a lot more countries that are generating medium sized revenue that it would be quite difficult to list them all and wouldn't be visually appealing to stakeholders while reading it.


-A map would be a better representation when displaying countries becasue visually it is much easier to look at with just one glance. When hovering onto each country, the overall revenue trend will be visiable. 


-The bottom left focuses directly on the months of Oct-Dec in revenue trend since supposedly, we are in the month of December and want to figure out what is happening in between those months. This applies to every mid-size country. 


-Bottom middle represents numerical representations of of revenue per each country. Good for looking at the data at a glance.


-Bottom right represents a pie chart that represents the diversity of each performance metric. It is shown that there are more countries that have a downward trend in revenue than there are those with an upward trend in revenue. There are even more countries with no latest trend whatsoever.

-Consists the countries that generate the smallest amout of revenue possible. They consist of Behrain, Czech Republic, Lithuania, and Saudi Arabia.

-Even in the smallest markets, there are more countries with revenue that are decresing. There are markets that don't have any latest data (Nov-Dec) like Lithuana and Saudi Arabia. And there are countries with our eCommerce store that have actually started not to long ago, e.i, these stores these countries like Czech Republic, Lithuana, and Saudi Arabia seem to have only lasted about a month or two. If there is no recorded data since its last recorded revenue data which is a decrease, it must be the likelihood that it has failed.

-We can also see that the downward trend in these countries have decreased dramatically as in somewhere around the 80s to upper 90s percent.

We clearly see that "Set of Items" is the most popular, and "Yellow Items" seem to be the least popular amongst all peoples in each country. It is also in order amongst all seven groups of items from most popular to least popular. We can perhaps focus on those that are not doing so great and do some research to figure out why is it not doing well. We need to figure why is our most popular group of items doing so well, and once we have that information, figure out if this info could applied to those that we are try to push.

-The bottom left showcases a reference of each individual items grouped together to create these grouped items. 

-The dashboard can also be filtered out to view the item demographic analytics of each country.

-This here represents a prediction of how many customers can why expect to have in the upcoming year. Since customers are one of the key drivers that influence revenue growth, it's best to start there.

-The blue represents the actual data and the pink represents the estimated data. And our blue line with are acyual data classified as the blue dots reads that it is almost as close to our prediction, giving it an R-Squared number of 87% out of 100%, just only a 12% difference, which almost as good, it is only a prediction. 

-And it is clearly show a positive trend rate for the number of customers being recieved each month.

-We can then compare the future months with the predicted numbers of customers that we are expected to have with the number of customers that we will actually going to have and evaluate to see if we met our expected number.

-From October 2010 to December 2011, it is seen that revenue has been graduately increasing. However, between the months on November 2011 to December 2011, revenue drastically decreases by 82%.


-We want to find the major factor that is causing this. The amount of customers per month lines up almost directly with the revenue trend line. This can conclude that the amount of custimers visited from our UK stores have much more to with the sudden decrease in revenue earnings.


-On the side of each chart, two charts displaying positive regression trends are shown on the right side of each chart. This is the correlation between the amount of customers and revenue, and we want to find out if there is a strong correlation between the two. These dots that correspond between the amount of customers and revenue are almost aligned with our regression line which makes this a strong correlation. Which proves that customer retention heavily affects revenue earnings.
